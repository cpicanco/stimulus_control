# Stimulus Control

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/17609066.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/17609066)

Stimulus Control is a fork of EAM (https://github.com/eep-lab/eam).

- It is aimed at fast programming of behavioral experiments.
- It can be extended to Design, Present, Record and Archive a wide range of behavioral experiments.
- It was designed for Participants, Researchers and Developers.
- It is a prototype to run non time-critical experiments.
- It is being inspired by OpenSesame, Psychopy and Expyriment.

### Some features

  - Text Messages
  - Simple Discriminations
  - Conditional Discriminations
  
  - Task Styles
    - Feature positive effect (uses keyboard as operandum)
    - Go/No-Go (using keyboard or mouse as operandum)
    - MTS (using keyboard or mouse as operandum)
    - SPAN (using keyboard or mouse as operandum, work in progress)
    - and others
    
  - Stimuli (antecedents, consequents):
    - Sounds using the (non-free, as in freedom) Bass library (a substitute is in need)
    - Images (jpg, bmp, png), opaque or transparent
    - Videos using the LCLVLC component and the libvlc library will be implemented.
  
  - Backgrounds
    - Random visual mask
    - Colors
    
  - Responses (schedules of reinforcements):
    - CRF, EXT
    - FT, VT
    - FR, VR
    - FI, VI,
    - DRH, DRL

  - Designs
    - Free operant
    - Discrete Trials
    
  - Performance Assessment/Criteria
    - Consecutive Hits
    - Hit porcentage in Bloc
  
  - Blocs of Trials
    - Create blocs of trials
    - Concatenate blocs of trials
    - Concatenate blocs of trials based on participant's performance (if criteria was reached, go to bloc x, if not go to bloc y)

  - Timestamped Events
    - Starts and endings of trials, Hits and Misses are timestamped by default
    - Custom timestamps can be implemented through custom trial types
    - For high precision and high granularity timestamps
      - We use EpikTimer package on windows 
      - We use `clock_get_time` on linux
  
  - Pupil Communication (https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil)
    - Auto start/stop of Pupil Recordings
    - Auto start/stop (and custom start) of the current selected Pupil Calibration Method
    - Prompts for unsuccesful calibration
    - More details about our implementation here: https://github.com/cpicanco/pupil-fpc

  - Cross-Platform. Tested under Windows (7, 8 and 10), Crunchbang 11, Ubuntu LTS (16.04) and Debian 9.

  - Free software, GPL3, compiled with Lazarus RAD IDE (1.8.2) and FPC (3.0.4).
  
  - Core code was written using a Behavior Analytic ontology.


### Changes Made

- Adapted from Delphi to Free Pascal compiler and Lazarus development environment
- Replaced old GUI for a new prototype one
- Fixed some timing bugs
- Fixed some bugs related to the TTrial create/free life cycle
- New trial types inherited from TTrial
- Refactoring for better Behavior Analytic ontology fit.
